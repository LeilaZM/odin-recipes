    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p><em>serves four</em></p>
      <ul>
         <li>4 egg yolks</li>
         <li>3,5 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
         <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
         <li>1/8 of a teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
         <li>1 tablespoons water</li>
         <li>1 cup butter, <em>melted</em></li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
         <li>8 eggs</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar </li>
         <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>
         <li>4 English muffins, <em>split</em></li>
         <li>2 tablespoons butter, <em>softened</em></li>
      </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Make Sauce</strong></li>
          <p>To Make Hollandaise: Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.</p>
          <li><strong>Add Melted Butter</strong></li>
          <p>Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.</p>
          <li><strong>Poach Eggs</strong></li>
          <p>Preheat oven on broiler setting. To Poach Eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate</p>
          <li><strong>Brown the Bacon</strong></li>
          <p>While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.</p>
          <li><strong>Finishing Touches</strong></li>
          <p>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</p>
